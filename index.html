        <div class="text">The Schools need is a new age tool</div>
        <p>
          Team SchoolerPro was born out of the desperation, doubt and anxiety
          that affected schools when COVID19 became a reality. But it is
          designed to outlast not only outlast the pandemic but also re-imagine
          pedagogy for the New Generation of Students. Indian Schools, though
          may face a lot of criticism for the means of imparting education, they
          still remain the powerhouse of educating so many students.
        </p>
        <p>
          At SchoolerPro, we believe that what the Schools need is a new age
          tool, that helps in managing content and making it seamlessly
          available for their students to consume. SchoolerPro is imagined as a
          platform that unites - Teacher, Students, Administrators, Third Party
          content creator with the sole aim of re-inventing a childs education.
          All this without burning the pockets of parents in a pay-as-you-go
          model.
